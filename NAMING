NAMING CONVENTION

All default names must be in snake_case (with SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for macros,
defines and constants), unless otherwise specified.

Semantic:

  g###_* - user routines
  ig###_* - internal routines
  zg###_* - implementation-related routines
  zz_* - symbols not intended for users in any way (e.g. include guards)
  *_IG - include guard

Part marked as ### should be "ena" to get "gena" in library-wide routines, or
a shortened name of the data structure otherwise. Shortened names must have
from 3 to 5 characters and start with a consonant letter.

Function Arguments:

  p* - handle passed by pointer
  OUT_* - pointer to an output value

Macro Arguments:

  ptr_* - argument should be either a pointer variable or a pointer constant
  tp* - template parameter (rest must be in CamelCase, e.g. tpTypeInfo)

Variables and Constants:

  *_c - constant value

Types:

  *** - type alias
  *_e - enum
  *_s - struct
  *_u - union
  *_p - typed pointer
  *_ptr - untyped pointer
  *_f - functional type
  *_h - handle type
  *_x - any other user-defined type
